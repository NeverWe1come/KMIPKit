# Implementation Evidence

## T012 — Shared Rust/C parity fixture corpus

The source fixture corpus at `tests/fixtures/api/shared-capability-parity.json` defines six language-neutral cases for API-level discovery, per-configuration registry isolation, resource-limit error/redaction behavior, ordered mixed batch outcomes with a Pending correlation value, generic TTLV open-value/order preservation, and extension-registry recognition/preservation. Every case records stable 0043 and owning-feature requirement IDs, a literal input setup, expected observable output, error category when applicable, cleanup expectations, and Rust/C consuming test names. Extension cases resolve to the existing shared extension fixture source.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `835b4e8c` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_parity.PublicApiParityTests.test_shared_capability_parity_fixtures_cover_rust_and_c_contracts -v` | Expected failure: the shared API parity corpus did not exist. |
| Green | `6774abcc` | Same focused command | PASS: fixture corpus and the required capability, requirement, output, error, cleanup, consumer, and extension-source references were present and valid. |
| Refactor | `3c548559` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_parity -v`; `git diff --check` | PASS: all 8 parity tests passed; no whitespace errors. Reused one helper for capability-case lookup without changing fixture behavior. |

The Rust and C consumer test names are the planned consumers for subsequent binding tasks; this task establishes the shared input and expected-output source. Runtime C/JNI/Python parity and manifest-backed evidence remain gated by their respective implementation tasks.

## T002, T006, T007, and T068 — Release inventory and owner resolution

KMIP 2.1 defines 57 client-initiated operation types. The 1.0 catalog contains 56 `client_1_0` entries; Set Endpoint Role (§6.1.54) remains cataloged as `client_1_1` per the disposition recorded in specification 025. The release manifest and generator validate the 56-operation 1.0 inventory without changing the normative catalog.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `2efbb946` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_catalog_parity -v` | Expected failure before implementation: the generator expected 57 release operations while the approved catalog contained 56 `client_1_0` entries. |
| Green | `8c29168e` | Same focused command | PASS: exact in-scope inventory, numeric ordering, catalog identity, and exclusion of the `client_1_1` operation are validated. |
| Red | `c395bb16` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_operation_readiness.OperationReadinessSchemaTests.test_approved_release_operations_resolve_to_their_current_owner_specs -v` | Expected failure before owner reconciliation: 26 newly approved operation rows still had candidate/unassigned readiness. |
| Red | `62445866` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_operation_readiness.OperationReadinessSchemaTests.test_feature_owner_id_resolves_through_spec_feature_branch -v` | Expected failure: owner IDs such as KMIPKIT-0036 do not imply a `specs/036-*` directory; resolution must use the exact declared feature branch. |
| Green | `e8443f92` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_operation_readiness -v` | PASS: current approved owner records resolve by feature-branch metadata; remaining draft owners stay blocked. |
| Refactor | `8b46a35b` | `python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/api_manifest/tests -v`; `python tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check`; `git diff --check` | PASS: 93 tests passed, 3 symlink tests skipped because Windows denied symlink creation (WinError 1314), all 11 generated outputs current, and no whitespace errors. Cached header-only owner resolution removes the full-suite slowdown. |

T068 records the accepted release-scope decision only; it does not implement Set Endpoint Role. T011 remains open because a complete, reproducible export-audit report and reconciliation against every manifest row have not yet been committed; do not treat uncommitted audit observations as completion evidence.

## T016 — Runtime metadata mapping correction

The runtime metadata capability now has a public Rust `RuntimeVersion` value with the synchronized product version and ABI revision, and the C ABI reads its stable revision from the same Rust constant. Python's C thread-local error snapshot helpers are underscore-prefixed implementation details; Java's corresponding helpers remain package-private. The public API manifest maps the actual public version/capability surfaces and records the two C-only sticky-error exports as reviewed exclusions from shared facade parity. The C exports remain present and are still covered by FR-007.

QA reviewed the exclusion rationale and the cross-language mappings on 2026-10-12. The review confirmed that a returned Rust `ClientError` is caller-owned and is not equivalent to C's persistent thread-local snapshot/clear behavior. The exclusion therefore applies only to the shared product-facade inventory, not to the required C ABI.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `0328b93d` | `uv run --project bindings/python --with pytest -- python -m pytest bindings/python/tests/test_metadata.py -q` | Expected failure: the native error snapshot helper was still directly importable as a public Python module name. |
| Green | `40d08439` | Same focused command | PASS: 5 tests; internal snapshot helpers are private while safe, non-destructive C snapshot behavior remains tested. |
| Red | `98e930dc` | `cargo test -p kmipkit --test runtime_metadata public_version_matches_the_synchronized_package_version` | Expected compile failure: Rust had no runtime version value containing both product and ABI metadata. |
| Green | `40d08439` | `cargo test -p kmipkit --test runtime_metadata` | PASS: 2 tests; package version, ABI revision, and manifest-ready capability queries are covered. |
| Red | `88c60687`, `d48bca68`, `8c3f97d9` | Focused API manifest inventory tests | Expected failures: the Rust runtime version and ABI declarations were missing from the 1,760-entry Rust inventory and had no four-language mappings. |
| Green | `40d08439` | `uv run --with jsonschema -- python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/api_manifest/tests -v` | PASS: 99 tests, 3 platform-permission symlink skips; all runtime metadata declarations resolve and inventory count is 1,765. |
| Refactor | `dcaa1a32` | `uv run --with jsonschema -- python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_generate.ManifestGeneratorCliTests.test_generated_rust_metadata_lists_only_unblocked_c_mapped_capabilities -v` | PASS: generator tests assert exactly the approved eleven output destinations; the obsolete test proposing a twelfth generated file was removed. |

Additional focused verification: `cargo test -p kmipkit-ffi metadata_tests` passed 4 tests; `mvn -f bindings/java/pom.xml -Dtest=RuntimeMetadataTest test` passed 5 tests and ran the offline example; `python -B tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check` verified all 11 generated outputs; `cargo fmt --all --check` and `git diff --check` passed. This evidence closes only the runtime metadata mapping slice; it does not close the full API inventory, binding facade, package matrix, blocked owner specifications, or release gate.

#### UTF-8 input normalization follow-up

The shared capability query now maps unpaired Unicode surrogates consistently to the public invalid-input error. Rust validates the supplied UTF-8 bytes; the C ABI rejects malformed UTF-8 without modifying the output value and records validation/invalid-input with delivery `NONE`; Java rejects malformed UTF-16 input; Python normalizes `UnicodeEncodeError` to `InvalidInputError` without exposing the invalid string. These are local manifest queries and do not send a KMIP request.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `735c36a0` | `bindings/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest bindings/python/tests/test_metadata.py -k unpaired_surrogate -q` | Expected failure: Python leaked `UnicodeEncodeError` instead of the manifest-declared `InvalidInputError`. The added C and Java adapter regression tests passed against their existing mappings. |
| Green | `8e011291` | `bindings/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest bindings/python/tests/test_metadata.py -q`; `mvn -f bindings/java/pom.xml -Dtest=RuntimeMetadataTest test -q`; `cargo test -p kmipkit-ffi metadata_tests`; `python -B tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check` | PASS: Python 7 tests, Java runtime metadata suite, C metadata tests, and all 11 generated outputs. |
| Refactor | `aa10ba0b`, `cc146e79` | `bindings/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest bindings/python/tests/test_metadata.py -q`; `mvn -f bindings/java/pom.xml -Dtest=RuntimeMetadataTest test -q`; `cargo test -p kmipkit-ffi metadata_tests`; `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; `python -B tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check`; `git diff --check` | PASS: Python 7 tests, Java runtime metadata suite, C metadata suite (6 tests), formatter, Clippy, all 11 generated outputs, and whitespace check. Clarified invalid-input docs in Python and Java and simplified the FFI UTF-8 error branch without changing behavior. QA review found only the missing Java `@throws` line; it was added and the Java runtime metadata suite passed afterward. |

### Reviewed C-only last-error exclusions

`kmipkit_last_error_get` and `kmipkit_last_error_clear` are C ABI diagnostics required by FR-007. The language facades expose failures as caller-owned Rust errors and Java/Python exceptions; they do not expose the C thread-local slot or its explicit clear operation. These exact symbols are excluded only from the cross-language facade parity inventory and remain in the generated C header and C API tests. This is a reviewed surface distinction, not a claim that FR-007's C requirement is out of scope.

## T027 — Python native loading and ABI verification

The Python package loads exactly one regular shared library adjacent to its generated CFFI declarations, or the explicit `KMIPKIT_NATIVE_LIBRARY` administrator override. It rejects a missing/ambiguous bundled artifact and a missing override without fallback; it performs no directory search or runtime download. Before exposing the FFI, it queries `kmipkit_version_get` and requires ABI revision 1. Load and ABI errors redact native paths and implementation details.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `874c697a` | `python -m pytest -q bindings/python/tests/test_native_loading.py` | Expected failure: the package-local loader helpers did not yet exist. |
| Green | `6d4f8b3c` | Same focused command | Added the injectable loader with explicit override, no-fallback, ABI mismatch, and redacted-error behavior. |
| Refactor | `ed920459` | Same focused command; reviewed `docs/architecture/ffi-and-bindings.md` | Clarified the administrator override contract and redacted failure expectations without changing loader behavior. |
| Red | `67354b1b`, `b931cdb3` | `python -m pytest -q bindings/python/tests/test_native_loading.py` | Added failing specifications for the canonical C ABI handshake and deterministic package-local native-library discovery before wiring them into the package import. |
| Green | `ac5df387` | `python -m pytest -q bindings/python/tests/test_native_loading.py` | Integrated CFFI loading with the generated package declarations, ABI query, and exact adjacent-library selection. |
| Refactor | `701d3002` | `bindings/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest bindings/python/tests/test_native_loading.py -q`; `git diff --check` | PASS: 11 loader tests. Expanded the architecture contract to document recognized library suffixes, regular-file/symlink handling, ambiguity rejection, ABI handshake, and absence of fallback/search/download. |

Final verification on Windows x86-64: `bindings/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest bindings/python/tests -q` passed 46 tests. `maturin build` produced `kmipkit-1.0.0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl`; installing it into an isolated target directory with `uv pip install --target ... --no-deps` and importing from that installed tree returned product version 1.0.0, ABI 1, and `generic_ttlv_model` available. QA independently reviewed the loader and wheel smoke, confirmed the no-fallback/redaction behavior, and approved closing T027. This does not close T028's Java/Python cross-platform CI matrix.

## T013 — Approved generic TTLV declaration ownership (partial)

The canonical cross-language declaration slice whose Rust mapping paths begin with `kmipkit_ttlv::` contains 101 rows: 76 generic-model rows owned by KMIPKIT-0004 and 25 `CodecLimits` rows owned by KMIPKIT-0005, distributed across the four language package families. This is distinct from the 95 rows in the `rust-kmipkit-ttlv` package itself (24 `declared`, 71 `blocked`). The manifest maps the cross-language slice to the two approved shared capabilities with their owner requirements and evidence. This closes only this audited slice; T013 remains open until the remaining published Rust crate declarations are audited and mapped or explicitly excluded under an accepted authority.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `0344edaf` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_manifest_v2.PublicApiManifestV2SchemaTests.test_ttlv_declarations_use_their_approved_shared_spec_owners -v` | Expected failure before owner reconciliation: the manifest had no `generic_ttlv_model` capability record, so the test failed with `KeyError`. |
| Green | `c0cc2a31` | `python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/api_manifest/tests -v`; `python tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check`; `git diff --check` | PASS: 94 tests passed, 3 symlink tests skipped because Windows denied symlink creation (WinError 1314); all 11 generated outputs current; no whitespace errors. |
| Refactor | `5d36f87c` | `uv run --with jsonschema -- python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/api_manifest/tests -v`; `python tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check`; `git diff --check` | PASS: 94 tests passed, 3 symlink tests skipped because Windows denied symlink creation (WinError 1314); all 11 generated outputs current; no whitespace errors. Strengthened the inventory assertion to require exactly 101 declarations split 76/25; no API behavior or manifest data changed. |

### T011/T013 — Reproducible Rust public-export audit (current partial snapshot)

The pinned Rust 1.94.0 / rustdoc JSON 57 audit report at [rust-export-report-2026-10-12.json](reports/rust-export-report-2026-10-12.json) was regenerated from the current continuation branch on Windows x64 with all Cargo features. The deterministic traversal now expands reachable trait-implementation members and transparent type-alias projections when identity, reachability, generic arguments, and predicates can be established. It emits exact issues instead of claiming completion when an implementation predicate remains unresolved. The command returned **1 as expected** because the manifest and issue gates remain open.

| Published package | Observed paths | Manifest rows | Exact matches | Missing from manifest | Not observed | Issues |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `kmipkit-ttlv` | 331 | 331 | 331 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `kmipkit-protocol` | 5,806 | 5,806 | 5,806 | 0 | 0 | 31 |
| `kmipkit-transport` | 365 | 365 | 365 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `kmipkit-client` | 1,031 | 1,031 | 1,031 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `kmipkit` | 1,915 | 1,915 | 1,915 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| **Total** | **9,448** | **9,448** | **9,448** | **0** | **0** | **39** |

There were no kind mismatches or approved Rust exclusions. All 39 issues are `unresolved-rustdoc-implementation-predicate`; the report records the exact implementation ID and reachable owner for each. The 7,681 previously missing rows now match exact blocked records with no signatures or language mappings. Their candidate owner is inherited only from an exact manifest owner; unresolved owners remain under the existing blocked `public_binding_surface` candidate. `matchesManifest` is true, but `complete` remains false until all 39 predicates are resolved. T011 remains unchecked.

| Verification | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Focused auditor tests | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_rust_exports -v` | PASS: 18 tests. |
| Full API-manifest tests | `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B -m unittest discover -s tools/api_manifest/tests -v` | PASS: 194 tests; 3 Windows symlink tests skipped because symlink creation was denied (WinError 1314). |
| Rust export inventory | `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B tools/api_manifest/audit_rust_exports.py --repo-root . --report specs/043-public-api-bindings/reports/rust-export-report-2026-10-12.json --check` | Report written; exit 1 with 9,448 observed, 9,448 matched, 0 missing, 0 not observed, 0 kind mismatches, and 39 unresolved predicate issues. Exit 1 is the expected open gate. |
| Blocked Rust reconciliation | `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B tools/api_manifest/reconcile_rust_exports.py --report specs/043-public-api-bindings/reports/rust-export-report-2026-10-12.json --write` | Added 7,681 exact `blocked` records without signatures, language mappings, or exclusions; owner candidates came only from exact manifest owners or the existing blocked `public_binding_surface` capability. |
| Reconciled export inventory | `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B tools/api_manifest/audit_rust_exports.py --repo-root . --report specs/043-public-api-bindings/reports/rust-export-report-2026-10-12.json --check` | Report written; exit 1 with 9,448 observed, 9,448 matched, 0 missing, 0 not observed, 0 kind mismatches, and 39 unresolved predicate issues. |
| KMIPKit FFI MSRV build | `cargo +1.94.0 build --locked -p kmipkit-ffi` | PASS on Windows x86-64; built `target/debug/kmipkit_ffi.dll` with the vendored `aws-lc-sys@0.45.0`. Optional NASM/stdalign probes emitted warnings; the build completed successfully. |
| MSRV C ABI allowlist | `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B tools/api_manifest/audit_binding_exports.py --repo-root . --c-only --c-binary target/debug/kmipkit_ffi.dll --check` | PASS: complete C audit, 180 exact manifest rows, 2 approved C-only exclusions, no missing/stale/kind/issues. |
| C consumer locally | `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -S bindings/c -B build/c-consumer` | Not run: CMake is not installed on this host. The GitHub C matrix remains the C-consumer verification path. |
| Generated manifest outputs | `python -B tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check` | PASS: all 11 generated outputs current. |
| Whitespace validation | `git diff --check` | PASS. |

| Phase | Commit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Red | `910f799c`, `ef257e79` | Reconciliation tests failed on missing exact blocked rows and absent nearest-owner inheritance, with assertion failures and no harness errors. |
| Green | `6c19b62a` | Added 7,681 exact blocked rows; the audit matched all 9,448 observed paths and preserved all 39 unresolved-predicate issues. |
| Refactor | `d792bc81` | `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_rust_export_reconciliation -v`; `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check`; `git diff --check` — PASS: 7 reconciliation tests passed, all 11 generated outputs were current, and the shared key extraction preserved the exact package/path pair. |

T011 remains open because 39 Rust implementation predicates remain unresolved and the remote Linux/macOS ABI checks have not yet been evidenced. All 9,448 Rust paths in this snapshot now have exact manifest rows; the 7,681 added rows remain blocked and therefore do not declare API capability or parity. The C, Java, and Python binding audit completes with exact manifest reconciliation on this Windows x86-64 host. T013 remains open because only the approved TTLV owner slice has been mapped; the remaining Rust package declarations are not yet reconciled.

### C/Java/Python public-export audit (local snapshot passes)

The deterministic non-Rust audit is checked in at [binding-export-report-2026-10-12.json](reports/binding-export-report-2026-10-12.json). On Windows x86-64, `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B tools/api_manifest/audit_binding_exports.py --repo-root . --report specs/043-public-api-bindings/reports/binding-export-report-2026-10-12.json --check` completed with exit code 0. All three scanners are complete; every observed declaration reconciles to its manifest row or exact approved exclusion, with no missing, stale, kind-mismatch, or issue records. The native ABI regression test detected nine unprefixed jitterentropy exports before the vendor patch and passed after it. CI now runs the C header/binary/manifest allowlist audit on Windows, Linux, and macOS against the C job's already-built library; cross-platform results remain pending remote CI.

| Package | Scanner complete | Observed | Manifest | Exact matches | Missing | Stale | Kind mismatches | Issues |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C | yes | 182 | 180 | 180 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Java | yes | 329 | 329 | 329 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Python | yes | 274 | 274 | 274 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

C's observed count includes `kmipkit_last_error_clear` and `kmipkit_last_error_get`, represented by exact approved exclusions because they are C-specific diagnostics rather than shared four-language capabilities. The C ABI patch removes the nine transitive `aws_lc_0_45_0_jent_*` symbols from the published dynamic library while retaining jitterentropy. Java and Python now reconcile their compiled/source public export surfaces exactly with manifest v2. The checked-in report preserves exact paths, kinds, locations, and counts for all three languages.

The binding-auditor changes have distinct failing-test and implementation commits, including the false-include-guard parser case and the real shared-library export leak. At the checkpoint represented by the original ABI Green commit `a7ecd323`, the separate behavior-preserving vendor Refactor had not yet been recorded; that statement is historical and does not close T011.

| Phase | Commit(s) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Red | `c4658505`, `ea830f13`, `e30697c9` | Added failing cases for binary C ABI exports, protected Java declarations, Python export resolution, and ordinal-only PE exports. |
| Green | `22550fc2` | Implemented C header/binary reconciliation, Java `javap -protected` inventory, and Python source export inventory. |
| Red → Green | `b092775c` → `e62a88fe` | C enum and Python public alias traversal tests, then inventory support. |
| Red → Green | `b117cda0` → `56b1641f` | Python same-path module alias test, then duplicate-path suppression. |
| Red → Green | `8fc86d3b` → `f92a13d7` | C tagged struct/union declaration tests, then aggregate inventory and fail-closed parsing. |
| Red → Green | `f53fdb96` → `0be674d1` | C multi-field declaration test for `int left, right;`, then inventory of both fields. |
| Red → Green | `53f34dc5` → `cf816836` | Python augmented `__all__` test, then literal `+=` export resolution and unresolved-import reporting. |
| Refactor | `9d0c18ef` | Extracted Python class-member inventory without changing behavior. At that earlier checkpoint the full export audit still exited 1; later Green commits resolved the binding discrepancies. |
| Red | `1395106`, `2ae084ce`, `ba3cafbe` | Added failing ABI leak, incomplete C include-guard, and C-only existing-binary audit cases. The ABI regression enumerated the nine AWS-LC jitterentropy exports before patching. |
| Green | `22b13a7a`, `a7ecd323` | Made include-guard recognition fail closed; vendored and patched `aws-lc-sys@0.45.0`, constrained the dependency-policy exception, removed leaked symbols from the published ABI, added the cross-platform C audit step, and reconciled C/Java/Python manifests. `python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/api_manifest/tests -v` passed 162 tests (3 skipped); the full binding audit `--check` exited 0; generator check verified 11 outputs. |
| Refactor | Pending | A behavior-preserving cleanup commit is still required for the vendor ABI change. |

T011 remains unchecked: an observed blocked declaration can count as an exact inventory match, but it cannot account for missing or stale paths, a kind mismatch, duplicate declarations, unsupported ABI exports, or incomplete traversal. No manifest data was fabricated to suppress these findings.

## T030 — Java/Python package metadata and user scope documentation

Java Gradle/Maven metadata and Python project metadata use the manifest's synchronized `releaseLine` value (`1.0.0`). The Java target is Java 17; Python package metadata and the 1.0 documentation target CPython 3.12 only. Bilingual package guides record the five Java/Python OS/architecture targets from the manifest, explain Java and Python native loading, explicit overrides, ABI 1 checks, redacted failures, and the absence of runtime executable-code downloads. They mark all six current manifest capability states and all 56 `client_1_0` operations (`blocked`) without claiming full operation parity or a published package release. Existing English and Spanish vendor-extension guides now distinguish implementation examples from the still-blocked release-parity status.

| Phase | Commit | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `79764c1a` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_t030_package_docs -v` | Expected failure: Java/Python version metadata was already aligned, but the bilingual runtime/loading/capability guides were absent. |
| Green | `cae998db` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_t030_package_docs -v` | PASS: 4 focused contract tests; added package metadata descriptions, synchronized versions, and bilingual package guides. |
| Refactor | `aba0b9d6` | `python -B -m unittest tools.api_manifest.tests.test_t030_package_docs -v`; `python -B tools/api_manifest/generate.py --check`; `mvn -o -f bindings/java/pom.xml validate -q`; `git diff --check` | PASS: 5 focused contract tests; all 11 generated outputs current; Maven metadata validation and whitespace check pass. Clarified that Python 3.12 is the only 1.0 package minor line and that vendor-extension examples do not establish verified release parity. |

The platform-matrix CI and offline load/install verification remain T028/T072 work; T030 documents the currently declared target matrix without claiming that every target has completed those checks.
