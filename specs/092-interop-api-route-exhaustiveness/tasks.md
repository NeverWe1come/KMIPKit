# KMIPKIT-0092 Tasks

- [x] T001 Audit pinned OASIS 2.0/2.1 inventories and normative value references
  and add red tests for missing operations, objects, attributes, TTLV types,
  assigned/reserved values, extension allocations, tag ranges, request/response
  branches, and normative boundary/error classes.
- [x] T002 Add red tests for route-capability manifest validation and missing
  case/version/route/encoding/transport matrix cells.
- [x] T003 Define the shared route-capability schema and authored capability
  manifest for Rust, C, Java, and Python public packages.
- [x] T004 Generate the exhaustive coverage matrix from the versioned catalog
  and per-language route capability manifest.
- [x] T005 Extend validation evidence and aggregation to retain every execution
  axis and compare normalized request/response results without overwriting
  repeated runs.
- [ ] T006 Add CI checks that reject missing/duplicate coverage, declared
  routes that do not call the named public API, incomplete generic TTLV
  roundtrips, and falsely positive cases.
- [ ] T007 Add cross-language fixture contracts for all matrix axes and
  deterministic byte comparison rules.
- [x] T008 Update documentation, requirement traceability, and generated
  artifacts.
- [ ] T009 Run common checks, review the scoped diff, commit Red/Green/Refactor
  evidence, push the feature branch, and remove `[WIP]` only after its exact-head
  CI passes.

T006 and T007 remain open until each separate language validator consumes the
generated matrix, invokes every named public route, exchanges requests and
responses with a controlled peer, and emits validated per-cell evidence. A
passing shared-contract job does not satisfy those language-level requirements.
