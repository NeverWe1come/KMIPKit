# Incremental verification record

This file records evidence as KMIPKIT-0012 is implemented. It is not the final
feature-wide verification record; binding parity, coverage gates, interoperability,
fuzzing, and the remaining acceptance criteria are still open.

## 2026-10-07 — bounded schema order validation

### Change

Fixed repeated schema-width work in nested Structure validation. Empty Structures
now perform no ordering work. Sparse non-empty Structures use indexed directed
edge lookups; denser Structures make one pass over the compiled edge list. The
sorted edge vector remains the deterministic source for iteration and error
selection.

Red/Green/Refactor commits:

- Empty repeated Structure amplification: `aba425c` / `385b402` / `1f3ca70`.
- Sparse order lookup work: `55764d0` / `9698697` / `e232887`.
- Sparse full-edge fallback: `8eb2b9d` / `c641674` / `c886882`.
- QA regression assertion for zero work on empty Structures: `442937d`.

### Verification

- Mutation sensitivity check: temporarily forced the full-edge fallback for an
  empty nested Structure. The regression failed with 2,550,000 order-edge work
  units against the expected zero. The temporary mutation was reverted.
- `cargo test -p kmipkit-protocol --lib many_empty_nested_structures_do_not_repeat_schema_width_work -- --nocapture` — passed (1 test).
- `cargo test -p kmipkit-protocol -p kmipkit-client --all-features --quiet` — passed.
- `cargo clippy -p kmipkit-protocol -p kmipkit-client --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` — passed.
- `cargo fmt --all --check` — passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

### Independent reviews and limits

- Independent security review: PASS for the repeated-work finding. The compiled
  edge index reserves fallibly; resource limits bound definitions, rules, and
  edges; deterministic behavior uses the sorted vector rather than map iteration.
- Independent QA review: PASS after adding the zero-work assertion for empty
  nested Structures. The sparse-work metric counts map lookup calls; it does not
  expose internal hash-table probes. These calls use Rust's randomized
  `HashMap`, whose lookup complexity is expected constant time. The edge/rule
  counts are bounded by the configured and hard schema limits.
- These reviews cover only this remediation. They do not replace the qualified
  independent human security review required before the 1.0 release or the
  feature-wide QA/security gates in T061–T063.
